         <h2> About </h2> 
        <p>
            <h3> “Having it all” is a dream some women try to achieve as they grow in their professional careers and build a family. The ability to be there to raise your children and still be there on the forefront of your professional journey is a tough act to balance.  
            <br>
            In Brazil, motherhood and career are major challenges for mothers. Reconciling childcare with professional life is a great challenge for mothers, who are forced to triple the workday.</h3>
            <dt> <h3> Do I heard triple working day?</h3> </dt>
            <dd> <h3> Yes! And it's a social problem that overloads women with multiple jobs: at home, at the office, at school meetings for their children, etc. This role is exacerbated when many women take care of everything on their own, including providing for the household. As a result, we have an increase in the rate of depression and heart attack among women and damage in several areas of life, especially health. </h3> </dd> </p>

         <h2> Symbol
         <p><h3> The cactus grows in the northeast region of the country, where its blooming flowers symbolize the “end of the drought” in very arid areas.
            In order for the population of this area to be able to live, several NGOs as well as the state collaborate together to help people with water, food, education and much more.
            <br>
            <br>
            The cactus is a symbol of strength and persistence just like a mother, who need also a support network, to develop the best possible. </h3> </p>
